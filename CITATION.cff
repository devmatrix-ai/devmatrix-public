abstract: >-
  DevMatrix is a specification-to-system compiler that transforms
  natural language specifications into complete, verifiable full-stack
  applications. Unlike LLM-based approaches (copilots, agents, prompting),
  DevMatrix guarantees determinism (same specification produces same system
  with same cryptographic hash), completeness (backend, frontend, tests,
  infrastructure), and verifiability (cryptographic evidence of reproducibility).

  This paper presents the problem, approach, guarantees, and empirical evidence
  from compilations of three real-world specifications: FLOWDESK (workflow
  management), Ghysels CRM, and MediCloud (healthcare).
